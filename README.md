# Educational-Password-Cracker-Java
(Educational Use Only)
This Java-based project is designed to demonstrate password cracking techniques for **educational purposes**. It focuses on hashing algorithms (SHA-256, MD5) and the various ways to generate password guesses using advanced techniques.

## Features
- **Multi-algorithm Support**: Cracks password hashes using SHA-256 and MD5 algorithms.
- **Password Variation Techniques**:
  - **Permutations**: Generates all possible permutations of the password.
  - **Leet-speak**: Converts common letters into symbols (e.g., "a" to "4", "s" to "$").
  - **Case Variations**: Generates different combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters.
  - **Prefix/Suffix**: Adds commonly used prefixes or suffixes to guesses.
  - **Number and Symbol Variations**: Adds numbers or symbols at different positions.
  - **Contextual Passwords**: Generates variations based on username and year (e.g., User2024, 2024User).
- **Ethical and Educational**: Designed for learning purposes to understand password security weaknesses.

## How to Use
